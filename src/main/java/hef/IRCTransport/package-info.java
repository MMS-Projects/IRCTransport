/** hef's IRC Transport.
 * IRCTransport is a java plugin for the Bukkit Minecraft Server.
 *
 * The plugin acts as a bridge connecting Minecraft's in-game chat to a real
 * world IRC server.  The plugin creates an IrcAgent on behalf of each player,
 * and joins a configured irc server/channel.
 *
 * Several IRC commands are supported:
 * /me
 * /join
 * /leave
 * /nick
 * /names
 * /topic
 *
 * additionally, players can use /channel to change channels.
